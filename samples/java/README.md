# Export API Java Example

This Java example aggregates and counts builds from the last 24 hours by username.

## Minimum Gradle Enterprise version

This sample uses version 2 of the Export API, available since Gradle Enterprise 2021.2.
In order to use it with older Gradle Enterprise versions, please modify all occurrences of `/build-export/v2` to `/build-export/v1` in `ExportApiJavaExample.java`.

## Setup

To run this sample:

1. Replace the hostname value of the `GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_SERVER` constant in [`ExportApiJavaExample.java`][ExportApiJavaExample] with your Gradle Enterprise hostname.
3. Set the appropriate authentication environment variables (see below).
2. Run `./gradlew run` from the command line.

### Authentication

We recommend using the Bearer token authentication which has been available since Gradle Enterprise 2021.1.

#### Bearer token authentication (access key)

1. Create a Gradle Enterprise access key for a user with the `Export API` role as described in the [Export API Access Control] documentation.
2. Set an environment variable locally: `EXPORT_API_ACCESS_KEY` to match the newly created Gradle Enterprise access key.

#### Basic authentication (user / password)

Non-SAML users can authenticate via basic auth.

1. Create a Gradle Enterprise user with the `Export API` role as described in the [Export API Access Control] documentation.
2. Set two environment variables locally: `EXPORT_API_USER` `EXPORT_API_PASSWORD` to match the newly created Export API user credentials.
